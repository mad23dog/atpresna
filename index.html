Reasons might include: device doesn't meet needs, environmental barriers, lack of training, breakdown, or changing needs. Only after investigating can appropriate action be taken. Closing the case (A), switching devices (C), or reporting (D) without investigation abandons the consumer."

AT needs change as they grow, develop new skills, and face new academic demands. Adults with stable conditions (A, C) need less frequent follow-up.
